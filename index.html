         <div class="about">
            <p>
                As a high school student, my goal was to become a musician. I transfered to an arts high school and even went to 
                Baylor University for a few semester as a bassoon performance major. Suprisingly, music has a plethora of transferable 
                skills such as strong team work and persistance, and While I did thoroughly enjoy the time dedicated to 
                musicianship, I decided that pursuing a career with greater earning potenital would help me more later on in life. 
                    
             </p>
            <p>
                The start of my software engineering journy started with the Odin Project. I was able to get through most of the 
                foundations module before I decied that I needed some more structure in my learning process. That's where Thinkful 
                came in! I found the incredible results of the Thinkful coding course to be compelling enough for me to start my 
                coding journey in earnest.
