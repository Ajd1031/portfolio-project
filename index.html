                    As a high school student, my goal was to become a musician. I transfered to an arts high school and even went to 
                    Baylor University for a few semester as a bassoon performance major. Suprisingly, music has a plethora of transferable 
                    skills such as strong team work and persistance, and While I did thoroughly enjoy the time dedicated to 
                    musicianship, I decided that pursuing a career with greater earning potenital would help me more later on in life.

                    The start of my software engineering journy started with the Odin Project. I was able to get through most of the 
                    foundations module before I decied that I needed some more structure in my learning process. That's where Thinkful 
                    came in! I found the incredible results of the Thinkful coding course to be compelling enough for me to start my 
                    coding journey in earnest.
